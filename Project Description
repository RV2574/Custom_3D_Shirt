Project Description:
This project allows users to customize a 3D model of a shirt using an interactive web interface. Users can select colors, patterns, and potentially even upload their designs to see how they would look on the shirt in real-time. The project uses React for the frontend and React Three Fiber for rendering the 3D model.

Key Features
3D Shirt Model: The shirt is rendered as a 3D object that users can interact with.
Customization Options: Users can change the color, pattern, and potentially texture of the shirt.
Real-time Updates: As users make changes, the shirt model updates in real-time to reflect these changes.
Technical Requirements
React:

Why Used: React is used to build the interactive user interface. Its component-based architecture allows for reusable UI components, which is ideal for a dynamic project like this. The virtual DOM in React also helps in efficiently updating the 3D model and UI elements in real-time as users make changes.
Key Points:
Component-based Structure: Helps in maintaining and scaling the project.
State Management: React’s state and props mechanisms are leveraged to manage the customization options and update the 3D model.
React Three Fiber:

Why Used: React Three Fiber is a powerful library that brings Three.js into the React ecosystem. It allows for creating complex 3D scenes using JSX, making it easier to integrate 3D content within React applications.
Key Points:
Declarative 3D Graphics: Just like how React works with the DOM, React Three Fiber allows for declarative 3D programming.
Integration with React: Seamless integration with React components, which makes handling state and props straightforward, even with complex 3D scenes.
Three.js:

Why Used: Three.js is the underlying 3D engine that powers the rendering of the shirt model. It provides all the necessary tools to work with 3D graphics in the browser.
Key Points:
WebGL Abstraction: Three.js abstracts the complexities of WebGL, making it easier to work with 3D graphics.
Custom Shaders & Materials: You might have used custom shaders or materials to give the shirt realistic textures and lighting.
SCSS (Sassy CSS):

Why Used: SCSS is used for styling the application. It extends CSS with additional features like variables, nesting, and mixins, which help in writing cleaner and more maintainable styles.
Key Points:
Modular Styling: SCSS allows you to break down the styles into modules, making it easier to manage large stylesheets.
Variables and Mixins: These features reduce redundancy and allow for theme customization in your project.
Material UI (Optional):

Why Used: If you used Material UI for any part of your UI, it’s likely because it provides a consistent and modern look with pre-built components.
Key Points:
UI Consistency: Ensures a consistent user interface across different parts of the application.
Responsive Design: Material UI’s grid and other layout components ensure your app is responsive.
Custom .glb Model:

Why Used: The .glb file format is a binary version of GLTF (GL Transmission Format), which is a widely used format for 3D models. It’s efficient and compact, making it ideal for web applications.
Key Points:
Efficiency: The .glb format is lightweight, which reduces load times.
Compatibility: It’s well-supported by Three.js and React Three Fiber, ensuring smooth rendering.
Key Points for an Interview
Why React and React Three Fiber:
Explain how React’s component-based architecture is well-suited for the dynamic and interactive nature of your project. Mention how React Three Fiber integrates Three.js into React, allowing you to manage 3D scenes using React’s declarative style.

Understanding of 3D Rendering:
Discuss your understanding of 3D rendering in the browser, how Three.js simplifies working with WebGL, and the importance of optimizing 3D assets (like the .glb file) for web performance.

Handling Real-time Updates:
Highlight how you managed real-time updates efficiently using React’s state management, ensuring that changes made by the user are reflected instantly in the 3D model.

CSS and SCSS:
Explain how SCSS helped you manage complex styling needs and how you structured your styles to be modular and maintainable.

Challenges and Solutions:
Discuss any challenges you faced, such as handling large 3D assets, optimizing performance, or managing state between different components, and how you overcame them.

Future Improvements:
Mention potential future improvements, like adding more customization options, optimizing the 3D rendering for mobile devices, or implementing server-side rendering for better SEO.
